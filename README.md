# Fish Tracker

![]()
Fish Tracker is a project created to log the fish you catch during or after a fishing trip. The user starts off by signing in using google Oauth to have access to links. There are 4 links in which the user can interact with. The "other anglers" link will send the user to a page with a list of other users who have signed in to the site. Next there's a "Add A Fish" link that will send the user to a page with various inputs to created a fish that they've caught. Finally you have a "View my fish" link which will send the user to a list of fish that have been entered. Each fish that have been added can be clicked on, and will send the user to a "details" page in which the user that created the fish will be able to edit it or delete it. If a user clicks on a fish that wasn't created by them then they will just look at the fishes details.
